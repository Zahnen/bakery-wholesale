# **Wholesale Order Management Application**
### A web application using C#, December 18, 2020

#### By Zahnen Garner

_This web application was created as my independent project for my ninth week at Epicodus. The application allows users to manage wholesale vendor accounts and orders within that vendor profile. The application was created to apply concepts I learned this week which include the basics of writing web applications in C#, creating custom classes and methods in C#, testing C# apps in MSTest, using ASP.NET Core, and using MVC routing following RESTful conventions ._

## Setup/Installation Instructions

### To run the project locally:

* _Open your git-capable command line program (we recommend Terminal on Mac or Git Bash on PC)_
* _Ensure you are within the directory you'd like the file to be created in._
* _Enter the command "$ git clone https://github.com/zahnen/bakery-wholesale" in your command line_
* _Once cloned, use the "$ cd " command to navigate to the directory created in the previous step._
* _You must have .NET Core V2.2 installed in order to run the console app successfully. If you do not have .NET Core V2.2 installed, find more information and download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)_
* _Once in the newly cloned directory, enable testing by running "dotnet restore" within both directories found at the root level of the project directory (BakeryWholesale and BakeryWholesale.Tests)._
* _To test specs outlined in the Specs section, navigate to the BakeryWholesale.Tests directory in your command line and run "dotnet test"_
* _To run the console application, enter "dotnet run" in your command line while in the BakeryWholesale directory._
* _Your command line will open a server (likely "http://localhost:5000/"). Navigate to this URL in your browser to view the project._
